Repo Description: Face Recognition for beginners. Different ways to implement face recognition. 

Welcome! In this repository, you're going to build a face recognition system. 

Face recognition problems commonly fall into one of two categories: 

- **Face Verification** "Is this the claimed person?" For example, at some airports, you can pass through customs by letting a system scan your passport and then verifying that you (the person carrying the passport) are the correct person. A mobile phone that unlocks using your face is also using face verification. This is a 1:1 matching problem.

- *Face Recognition** "Who is this person?" This is a 1:K matching problem.Welcome! In this repo, you're going to build a face recognition system.
